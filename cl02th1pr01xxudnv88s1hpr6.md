## Mentorship, mock interviews & giving back to the community!

**2021**, a year that changed our lives in multiple unimaginable ways.  With the pandemic making us strive hard to survive, we all still witnessed the wonders of technology including the major transition from *Spider-Verse* to the *Metaverse*. The virus's pangs reached my home as well and I along with my entire family were tested positive for COVID. With God's grace, everyone recovered well. While I was stuck alone in isolation, it got me thinking - what is that one thing I‚Äôve always wanted to do apart from being a developer? It didn't take long to find an answer. I‚Äôve always wanted to help the community by sharing my learnings with individuals and budding developers to aid their journey into the beautiful world of tech. 

Fortunately, 2021 had more in store for me than just COVID. I am Vinit Shahdeo currently working as Postman at SWE II. Oops, sorry, as SWE II at Postman!



## Software Engineer II at Postman

From learning about APIs to a company that helps you build APIs, my journey at Postman from an intern to SWE II has been exhilarating. If I had to describe my life at Postman in a nutshell I would say API-first vision, challenging projects, amicable team and JavaScript. 

What makes me get up and work every day at Postman is knowing that what I do, impacts millions of developers across the world.

## Hacktoberfest

Hactoberfest, in my opinion, should be renamed as Hack-to-perfection. As a developer, I get more excited about Hacktoberfest and open-source than holidays. The rush to get as many first-timers' pull requests merged and the happiness that came along with it. This year, more than 1000 newbies kickstarted their open-source journey with my **[Road-to-Hacktoberfest](https://vinitshahdeo.dev/hacktoberfest-2021)** initiative. This is a developer's version of getting 100K views on your reel.

## GitHub Star 2021 and 2022

This is what my [GitHub](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo) looked like when I began my open source journey. Blank! I had no idea where to begin and how to proceed.  Many of you would be in that place while reading this. Don't worry I have got your back there! My quest that began with ‚ÄúHow does Facebook exactly work‚Äù became the beginning of my journey  ‚ÄúHow I became a GitHub Star twice‚Äù. For those of you unfamiliar with the term it is GitHub's way of expressing gratitude to influencing people who help the community and I am more than delighted to write that I got recognized again. Connected a lot of green dots to make it to a Star!

## Giving back to the community

In my journey of tech and open-source, 2021 has been more about growth and giving back to the community. From being mentored to mentoring, a lot has changed over the years. This pandemic made me realize all your plans and goals may not turn out exactly the way you want them to, life is unpredictable!  ‚ÄúBe the mentor you wanted to have as a learner‚Äù  and I am trying to become that. If you feel overwhelmed with so many resources and tutorials, find yourself stuck in the tutorial hell, and if you aspire to become a developer.; don't only build projects, build your dreams!
