## A curated list of beginner-friendly issues for Hacktoberfest 2021

### Hi there! üëã

Tomorrow is September 1st, which means that **Preptember has arrived, and Hacktoberfest is just around the corner**! In preparation for October, the entire month of September is dedicated to learning and hunting for the repositories. Here I am back again to help you in completing the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) challenge!

It‚Äôs that time of year again when we come together to support and celebrate the open source technologies we use and love! Because [GitHub](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo) is my homepage, the month of October has always been a time of celebration for me. Every year in October, hundreds of thousands of developers around the world make their first-ever contribution on GitHub. More than 500 pull requests were opened for my repositories last year. Helping hundreds of people to mark their identity on GitHub was ineffable. This year, @[Dev](@iamdevvalecha),  @[Aman](@thisisamank), @[Pranjal](@pranjalbareth), and [13 amazing folks](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Hacktoberfest2021/blob/main/MENTORS.md) have joined me so far. I am thankful to the community members who have felt this way in mentoring newcomers.

It can be difficult to know where to begin when it comes to contributing to open-source, especially if you don't have a particular repository in mind. **To prep you, I've compiled a [list of beginner-friendly issues(& repos)](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Hacktoberfest2021/) ahead of time so you hit the ground running as soon as Hacktoberfest begins.**
