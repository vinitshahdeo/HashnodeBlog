## Milepost: From a GitHub User to a GitHub Star

### Hello World,

I'm writing with a blissful bright smile that I have been recognized by GitHub as a [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/vinitshahdeo). For those of you who got caught up in the jargon, the honour of becoming a part of the **GitHub Stars Hall of Fame** is not any less than getting a Gold Play Button from YouTube.

> _The GitHub Stars program thanks GitHub’s most influential developers and gives them a platform to showcase their work, reach more people, and shape the future of GitHub. Till now, there are just **46 GitHub stars worldwide**. [Learn more](https://stars.github.com/program/)._

During second last week of March, my usual work-day Friday unfolded into a surprising evening, which was matched by the thrill of receiving an email that read out the *'few magical words'* every developer wants to hear - ***"Congrats, you're a GitHub Star!"*** 🌟

I am grateful to GitHub for recognizing the work I have done and my journey as a developer. Not only has GitHub helped me hone my skills but it has [introduced](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/vinitshahdeo/discussions/1) me to some exceptional developers, who are now my closest pals. **Give me a cheer if our meet-cute story includes GitHub**. 🍻

As I always say the green dots on my GitHub profile represent [my wandering expeditions](https://dev.to/vinitshahdeo/my-journey-from-0-to-1k-followers-on-github-1n6h) - from one repo to another. Five years ago I was just a curious soul wondering how Facebook works and back in 2019, my curiosity and the open source community led me to become a [Software Engineer at Postman](https://medium.com/@vinitshahdeo/software-engineering-internship-experience-at-postman-182df16ef33f), the world's leading collaboration platform for API development.

**Open Source kept me on my toes and encouraged me to always strive better.** The *['GitHub' way of life](https://www.opensourceforu.com/2020/07/if-you-are-a-techie-your-home-page-should-be-github-not-instagram/)* has boosted my motivation and reciprocating all that I have received, I now strive to give more to the open-source community.
