## Muddle through Hacktoberfest 2021 like a Pro 🎉

**Hacktoberfest** is a well-known technical festival that encourages new open-source contributions. So what occasion can be more auspicious to kick-start your open source journey and get started with contributing to projects that can impact thousands or millions of people. In my [previous post](https://vinitshahdeo.dev/beginner-friendly-issues-for-hacktoberfest-2021), I have shared a list of  [beginner-friendly issues](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Hacktoberfest2021/#beginner-friendly-issues) so that you can get the ball rolling once the Hacktoberfest'21 kicks off.

Students and early contributors to open source often get lost in the hurdle of getting the right projects. Newbies are always curious about the following questions:

- **As a beginner, how should I get started with GitHub?** 🤔
- **Where can I find beginner-friendly repositories/issues?** 🧐
- **Can someone mentor me to complete my Hacktoberfest challenge?** 🥺

In my initial days, I have faced hurdles too. So, I don’t wish that for my juniors and early contributors. In an effort to make [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) easy for novices, I along with a few of my pals have decided to start an initiative.

### An informal initiative 🤝

We have started an informal initiative to address the above queries and mentor the beginners for a seamless experience. 
- **If you are a beginner, this blog will guide you on getting started with open source and finding the right mentor**, and 
- **If you happen to be experienced in this field, we would be more than grateful to onboard you as a mentor**.

39 people have already joined these quests to help beginners kickstart their open-source journey. We are compiling a list of [beginner-friendly issues](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Hacktoberfest2021#beginner-friendly-issues) so that the Hacktoberfest enthusiasts can get their minds playful. We are starting this open-source celebration journey with an optimistic vision of hitting the following number:

- **100 Mentors**
- **1000 Contributors**
- **250 Repositories**
- **500 Issues**
- **50 Events**

The aforementioned metrics are achievable if we become a workforce of approximately 100 mentors along with curious beginners and professionals. Currently, we’re 61 mentors short.

> *I salute all the amazing [mentors](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Hacktoberfest2021/blob/main/MENTORS.md) who decided to trade away the hours that they could use to pursue their own career goals and spend them on guiding newbies in getting started with GitHub. 🙌*
