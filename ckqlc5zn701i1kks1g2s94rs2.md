## I tried GitHub Copilot (and you should, too!) 🤖 🚀

### Hello Dev Community 👋

Today, I kicked off my day with an invitation to start testing [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/), an AI pair programmer! **Copilot, like GPT-3, is a game-changer in software development**. It's fascinating to see AI being used in coding. After a day of use, I believe AI will undoubtedly lead us to low-code and no-code software development. This AI assistant was trained on a data set with a considerably higher concentration of publicly available source code, and of course it's much more than auto-completion. It learns from you and adapts to your coding style.

### GitHub Copilot: Your AI pair programmer 🤖

> According to Wikipedia, **Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in*. 

With Copilot, two coders(*one of those coders is virtual*) will work on the same project to catch each others’ mistakes and speed up the development process. You won't have to waste time looking for APIs, modules, or other alternatives to finish your project. 🐱‍💻

Currently GitHub Copilot is in a limited technical review and enrolled for a limited users. The preview version works with `Python`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Ruby`, and `Go`, but the upcoming versions will support more languages.

![GITHUB COPILOT VSCODE EXTENSION](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1625167360978/KyCvlMLnC0.png)

It's available as an extension for Visual Studio Code editor. Access to GitHub Copilot is limited to a small group of testers during the technical preview of GitHub Copilot. If you don’t have access to the technical preview, you will see an error when you try to use this extension. **Don’t have access yet? [Sign up for the waitlist](https://github.com/features/copilot/signup) for your chance to try it out. GitHub will send you an email once your wait is over!** 🌟
